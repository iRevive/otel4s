    *   <p> Its value SHOULD persist across launches of the same application installation, including through application
    *   upgrades. It SHOULD change if the application is uninstalled or if all applications of the vendor are
    *   uninstalled. Additionally, users might be able to reset this value (e.g. by clearing application data). If an
    *   app is installed multiple times on the same device (e.g. in different accounts on Android), each
    *   `app.installation.id` SHOULD have a different value. If multiple OpenTelemetry SDKs are used within the same
    *   application, they SHOULD use the same value for `app.installation.id`. Hardware IDs (e.g. serial number, IMEI,
    *   MAC address) MUST NOT be used as the `app.installation.id`. <p> For iOS, this value SHOULD be equal to the <a
    *   href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/identifierforvendor">vendor identifier</a>. <p>
    *   For Android, examples of `app.installation.id` implementations include: <ul> <li><a
    *   href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/manage-installations">Firebase Installation ID</a>. <li>A
    *   globally unique UUID which is persisted across sessions in your application. <li><a
